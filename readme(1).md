#### \## Overview



The project includes 39 practical programs focused on:



1\. Prime number analysis

2\. Divisor-based arithmetic functions

3\. Euler’s Totient \& Möbius functions

4\. Modular arithmetic \& cryptographic concepts

5\. Mathematical sequence and numerical property checks

6\. Higher-level number theory (Miller–Rabin, CRT, Pollard Rho, etc.)



Each practical includes:



1\. Python implementation  

2\. Time \& space efficiency checks  

3\. Mathematical explanation  

4\. Concepts and skills learned
